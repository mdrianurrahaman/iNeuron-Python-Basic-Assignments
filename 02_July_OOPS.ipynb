Multiple inheritance, on the other hand, allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes. The primary difference lies in the number of parent classes a derived class can have. Single inheritance can lead to simpler and more manageable class hierarchies, while multiple inheritance offers more flexibility but can also introduce complexity and ambiguity."
