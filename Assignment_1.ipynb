    "An expression in programming is made up of one or more operands and operators, combined in a way that represents a computation or evaluation. Expressions can be simple, such as a single value, or complex, involving multiple operands and operators. Here's what expressions are typically composed of:\n",
    "\n",

    "Operands are the values or variables involved in an expression.\n",

    "Operators:\n",

    "The type of operator used determines the operation performed on the operands.\n",
    "All expressions, regardless of their complexity, serve the purpose of evaluating to a single value. When an expression is evaluated, the operators are applied to the operands according to the rules of precedence and associativity, resulting in a new value. The value produced by evaluating an expression can be of any data type, depending on the types of the operands and the operation performed.\n",

    "Expressions are fundamental components of programming languages and are used extensively in writing code to perform computations, make decisions, and manipulate data. They play a crucial role in specifying the behavior of programs and are used in assignments, function calls, control structures, and many other aspects of programming.\n",
